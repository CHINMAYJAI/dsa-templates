### How to know that we have to apply heaps
- Look for keywords like `“kth largest/smallest,” “top K,” “merge k lists,” “most frequent,” “stream,” or “repeatedly get min/max.”`

- If you need to quickly access the smallest or largest element many times, it’s probably a heap (priority queue).

### how to find out which type of heaps will apply maxHeap or minHeap

- Use min-heap when you want quick access to the smallest element or to keep the largest K elements.

- Use max-heap when you want quick access to the largest element or to keep the smallest K elements.
